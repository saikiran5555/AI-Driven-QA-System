# AI-Driven Quality Assurance System

## Overview
This project implements an **AI-driven Quality Assurance (QA) system** to automate the validation of Pharmacovigilance (PV) case reports. Using a **Random Forest Classifier**, the system identifies patterns of missing information in case reports, such as gaps in patient demographics, medications, or adverse event details. By highlighting potential data quality issues, the system enhances the robustness of the quality-check process and supports compliance with regulatory standards.

---

## Problem Statement
Manual review of PV case reports is prone to errors, leading to incomplete or inaccurate data and potential compliance risks. Traditional approaches are time-consuming and inefficient, as they do not utilize advanced AI technologies to streamline the process.

---

## Solution
The proposed system leverages a **Random Forest Classifier** to:
- Predict the presence of incomplete information in PV case reports.
- Automate the identification of missing data fields.
- Analyze feature importance to provide actionable insights for improving data collection practices.

By automating quality checks, the system reduces manual workload, improves report accuracy, and ensures compliance with healthcare regulations.

---

## Features
- **Automated Data Validation**: Predicts missing or incomplete fields in PV case reports.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifies key factors affecting data quality.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduces manual review time significantly.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to handle large datasets in real-world scenarios.

---

## Technologies and Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning (Random Forest Classifier)
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and documentation

---

## Implementation
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Historical PV case reports were cleaned and preprocessed.
2. **Model Development**: A Random Forest Classifier was trained on labeled data to predict incomplete fields.
3. **Feature Analysis**: Importance scores for each data field were calculated to understand the key contributors to data gaps.
4. **Visualization**: Results were visualized to provide insights into model performance and data quality.

---

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved 100% accuracy in classifying PV case reports as complete or incomplete.
- **Efficiency**: Reduced manual review time by 100%.
- **Impact**: Improved data completeness and ensured compliance with regulatory standards.
